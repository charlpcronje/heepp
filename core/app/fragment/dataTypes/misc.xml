        #################### MISCELLANEOUS  Data Types ####################
        Other miscellaneous data types are boolean, base64Binary, hexBinary, 
        float, double, anyURI, QName, and NOTATION.


        Legal values for boolean are true, false, 1 (which indicates true), 
        and 0 (which indicates false).

        Restrictions that can be used with the other data types:
        - enum          a Boolean data type cannot use this constraint
        - length        a Boolean data type cannot use this constraint
        - maxLength     a Boolean data type cannot use this constraint
        - minLength     a Boolean data type cannot use this constraint
        - pattern
        - whiteSpace

    <!-- 
        The anyURI data type is used to specify a URI 
        Example: http://www.w3schools.com/images/smiley.gif
        Note: If a URI has spaces, replace them with %20.

        This datatype corresponds normatively to the XLink href attribute. Its 
        value space includes the URIs defined by RFCs 2396 and 2732, but its 
        lexical space doesn't require the character escapes needed to include 
        non-ASCII characters in a URIs.

        The Recommendation states that "it is impractical for processors to 
        check that a value is a context-appropriate URI reference," thus 
        freeing schema processors from having to validate the correctness of the URI.
