        Restrictions that can be used with String data types:
        - enum
            Audi,Golf,BMW               - The only acceptable values are: Audi, Golf, BMW
        - length
            8                           - The value must be exactly eight characters

        - pattern
            [a-z]                       - "letter" The only acceptable value is ONE of the 
                                          LOWERCASE letters from a to z
            [A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]             - "initials" The only acceptable value is THREE of the 
                                          UPPERCASE letters from a to z
            [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z]    - "initials" The only acceptable value is THREE of the 
                                          LOWERCASE OR UPPERCASE letters from a to z
            [xyz]                       - "choice" The only acceptable value is ONE of the 
                                          following letters: x, y, OR z
            [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]   - "prodid" The only acceptable value is FIVE digits in 
                                          a sequence, and each digit must be in a range from 0 to 9
            ([a-z])*                    - "letter" The acceptable value is zero or more 
                                          occurrences of lowercase letters from a to z

                                          each pair consisting of a lower case letter followed 
                                          by an upper case letter. For example, "sToP" will be validated 
                                          by this pattern, but not "Stop" or "STOP" or "stop"

                                          or a number from 0 to 9
        - whiteSpace
            preserve                    - "address" The whiteSpace constraint is set to "preserve", which 
                                          means that the XML processor WILL NOT remove any white space characters
            replace                     - "address" The whiteSpace constraint is set to "replace", which means 
                                          that the XML processor WILL REPLACE all white space characters 
                                          (line feeds, tabs, spaces, and carriage returns) with spaces
            collapse                    - "address" The whiteSpace constraint is set to "collapse", which means 
                                          that the XML processor WILL REMOVE all white space characters 
                                          (line feeds, tabs, spaces, carriage returns are replaced with spaces, 
                                          leading and trailing spaces are removed, and multiple spaces are 
                                          reduced to a single space)

        The string data type can contain characters, line feeds, carriage 
        returns, and tab characters.

        The normalizedString data type also contains characters, but the XML 
        processor will remove line feeds, carriage returns, and tab characters.
