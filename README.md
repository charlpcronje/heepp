# HeEPP - Hyper eXtensible Element Pre-Processor

This framwork was started in 2014 but and over the years I kept on adding. When it was started composer did not exist so didn't NPM or any other package managers for PHP. 
So the framework has most of those things built in as well. As I now decided to update the framework to be compatible with PHP 8.1 I will also implement the newest package managers etc.
